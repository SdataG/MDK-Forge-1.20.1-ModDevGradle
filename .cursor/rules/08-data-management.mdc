This rule defines how persistent data for "FTBKingdoms" (kingdoms, claims, players, etc.) is managed.

**`SavedData` (World-Specific):**
*   `KingdomsSavedData.java` (or `FTBKingdomsWorldData.java`): Stores map of FTB Team ID -> Kingdom object. Contains treasury ID, claim IDs, roles, war status, rules, logs.
*   `ClaimsSavedData.java`: Map of Your Claim ID -> ClaimDetails (FTB Chunk link, upkeep, sub-claims).
*   `JailSavedData.java`: Jail locations, prisoner data.

**`Capability` (Player-Specific):**
*   `PlayerBountyCapability.java`: Player's bounty.
*   Attach to `ServerPlayer`, sync to client if needed.

**Serialization:** Use `CompoundTag`.

**Access:** Managers access/modify, ensuring saving.
